## Python Programs

Welcome to the `Python_Programs` repository! This repository serves as a curated collection of various Python scripts and projects, demonstrating fundamental concepts, common algorithms, and practical programming techniques.

## About This Repository

This repository is designed to be a comprehensive resource for Python code across different domains. It's organized into distinct folders, each focusing on a specific area of Python programming.

## Repository Structure & Contents

You'll find programs categorized into folders such as:

* **`Data_Structures_and_Operations`**: Contains scripts demonstrating the creation, manipulation, and use of core Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, along with common operations performed on them.
* **`Algorithms_and_List_Manipulations`**: Features implementations of basic algorithms, including sorting, searching, mathematical computations, and various techniques for processing and transforming lists and other iterable data.
* **`Functional_Programming_and_Algorithms`**: Explores Python's functional programming paradigms, showcasing the use of `map`, `filter`, `lambda`, `reduce`, and other higher-order functions, often applied to solve algorithmic challenges

Each folder contains individual Python `.py` files, typically with clear naming conventions that reflect their functionality.

## Thank you!
